# Feedback for the final assignment

Very neatly executed project! It is a joy to click through the steps in the notebook :) There are a couple of tiny issues with the code at the moment, but they are easy to fix. All in all, this work exceeds all expectations both in terms of the code, and in terms of the visual output and documentation. 

Please find detailed feedback below. Suggestions for improvement are marked as **bold**.

## Points:
- Major analysis steps / functionality (data acquisition, analysis and visualization): 40/40
- Overall documentation: 10/10
- Extra points: 5/5
- Total: 55/50


### Overall documentation and structure: 
- Overall the structure is excellent
- Readme provides an informative overview, and links to content (but **could mention more explicitly that the example data are included in the repository** - now it's unclear if the links lead out from the repo)
- Excellent description and instruction for using the tool
- Good that you indicate the discarded notebooks - you **could have also moved the drafts to a separate `drafts` folder** to keep the main project cleaner.
- Special kudos for the fantastic flow chart - **you could have also embedded the flowchart in the readme.**
- tutorial notebook is concise and showcases the usage of the tool very well, and data are stored neatly in their own locations. Excellent! 
- The routing tool feels a bit detached from the topic but that doesn't weigh down the body of the work.
- Excellent instructions for avoiding trouble when running the tool (for example, instructing to use a browser that works etc!)
- Comments and docstrings are very informative and the code is very readable. 

### Tools (data acquisition and analysis) 

- Example data is provided and user gets clear instructions on how to acquire data for their ownpurposes.
- The tools/ analyses (mostly) work exactly as intended and in a very eloquent way in my opinion. Fantastic!
- Minor code issues:
    - `Visualizer` calls `StaticMap` without the parameter `bins` under classified and causes an error in the notebook when plotting the classified static map. Minor mistake which was easily fixed. Otherwise the code runs flawlessly! 
    - I had with the interactive maps slowing down the notebook significantly but that's probably due to my system limitations only.
- This is a great example of a modular toolset (in the context of what we had time to learn during the autumn).

### Visualization 

- Visualizations are efficient and simple
- **Consistent colors in all the accessibility maps would make comparing them easier.**
- North arrow and all! Great work :)

### Extra merits

- exceeding expectations :)
