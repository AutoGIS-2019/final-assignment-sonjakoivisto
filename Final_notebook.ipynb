    "Target is to assess the development of biking routes between 2013 and 2018 in Helsinki area. I will map the times how fast a fast biker can get to each university campus in Metropolitan area (new Metropolia campus in Myllypuro included to bring some variety). In the light of the results, I will ponder if bike is a viable transportation option for students compared to public transportation in terms of transportation time. I will also map the development of biking traffic amounts from same years and ponder about the relation of possible change in travel time and possible change in traffic amount.  "
