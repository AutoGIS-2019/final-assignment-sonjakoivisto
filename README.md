# Final Assignment

### Status

Once you are finished with the final assignment, edit this readme and add "x" to the correct box:

* [ ] Submitted

* [x] I'm still working on my final assignment. 

### Instructions

Read the final assignment instructions from the course webpages [https://autogis.github.io](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/lessons/FA/final-assignment.html). Remember to write readable code, and to provide adequate documentation using inline comments and markdown. Organize all your code(s) / notebook(s) into this repository and **add links to all relevant files to this `README.md`file**. In sum, anyone who downloads this repository should be able to **read your code and documentation** and understand what is going on, and **run your code** in order to reproduce the same results :) 

**Modify this readme so that anyone reading it gets a quick overview of your final work topic, and finds all the necessary input data, code and results.** Add short descriptions, and provide links to relevant files under the topics below (modify the titles according to your topic). You can delete this intro text if you like. 

*Note: If your code requires some python packages not found in the csc notebooks environment, please mention them also in this readme and provide installation instrutions.*

*Note: Don't upload large files into GitHub! If you are using large input files, provide downloading instructions and perhaps a small sample of the data in this repository for demonstrating your workflow.*
